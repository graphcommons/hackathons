In a [two-day hackathon on structured journalism and network mapping](https://graphcommons.github.io/hackathons/2015/08/21/istanbul-yapisal-gazetecilik-en/) organized by [Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.com) at the Chamber of Architects in Istanbul, participants created semantic network models on topics in the field of human rights, civil society, and journalism. They created <a href="#maps">network maps</a> as well as built <a href="#tools">data tools</a> that compile relatively big data from available sources and turned them into graph databases in order to map and analyze the complex issues at hand.

An important outcome of the event was the initialization of the **rights data protocol**, an open data structure scheme that could enable information flow particularly between civic research projects in order to prevent recurring data work and reinforce their impact. It would also decentralize civic research data by moving it between applications and projects. No need to say, such a protocol can only flourish when used by many constituents. More on this later.

Below is selected work from the hackathon with short explanations, links to interactive maps, photos, and screenshots.

# Data Tools

We started the brain storming sessions with hackathon mentors including journalists and academics who work in human rights. Following the data models came out of this session, participants created data compiling tools and used the [Graph Commons API](https://graphcommons.com/dev) for generating graphs and mapping relationships.

All tools listed below are open source and available on Github. Contact their respective developers if you'd like to contribute.

### Graph-Commons-Excel-Lab
**[Graph-Commons-Excel-Lab](https://github.com/Batierk/Graph-Commons-Excel-Lab)** – a minimal front end for generating graph data structures from excel files. You upload an Excel file, select two columns, set a relation, then voila it generates a graph. Developed in C#, ASP, Javascript by [Batı Erk Yılmaz](https://graphcommons.com/users/1c1cf322-9514-495b-b080-128fcec357e7).

### Twitter to Graph Commons
**[graphcommons-egt](https://github.com/mehmetatas/graphcommons-egt)** – Finds tweets with specified hashtag and imports data into Neo4j & Graph Commons. Developed in Javascript Node.js by [Mehmet Ataş](https://graphcommons.com/users/60f7f782-f56a-488d-b223-61621ddc1c2c).

### TBMM Scraper
**[TBMM scraper](https://github.com/meclistakip/tbmm-scraper)** – Set of tools that extract data on parliamentary processes from the Turkey parliament (TBMM) and generates a "bureaucracy graph". Developed in Node.js by [Ahmet Kızılay](https://graphcommons.com/ahmetkizilay) with contributions from [Ufuk Kayserilioglu](https://graphcommons.com/users/542a548f-104f-4f35-9275-a297fbf5c122).

### GraphCommons TBMM Önergematik
**[Onerge Crawler](https://github.com/krk/onerge-crawler)** – Scrapes [tbmm.gov.tr](https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/) and collects "parliamentary questions" ("Soru Önergeleri") and turns the relations between Ministires, PMs, Political Parties, and Questions into a network map. Developed in C# by  [Kerem](https://graphcommons.com/users/e7bda695-c8c6-47da-85ec-57962639a08b).

# Network Maps

After the hand drawn graph data models, participants worked on creating a variety of network maps through manual data collection as well as programmatic data generation. Then the interactive maps were discussed and published on the Graph Commons platform.

For questions and comments you can contact the authors of the graphs below.
