In a [two-day hackathon organized by Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.github.io/hackathons/2015/08/21/istanbul-yapisal-gazetecilik-en/) at the Chamber of Architects in Istanbul, participants created network maps on topics in human rights, civil society, and journalism. They built tools that compile relatively big data from available sources into graph databases in order to generate network maps and analyze the issues at hand.

Below is selected work from the hackathon with short explanations, links to interactive maps, photos, and screenshots.
