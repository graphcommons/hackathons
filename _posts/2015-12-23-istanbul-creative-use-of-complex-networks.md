Today, graph data, as a subcategory of big data, is used for variety of smart applications such as recommendation engines in e-commerce and social media services, fraud analysis in finance, routing optimization in transportation, investigation in security, citizen "identification" in smart cities, communication routing in telecommunication and so on.

Whereas network mapping, as a method for working with graph data, offers a common language, that is *both visual and mathematical*.
This language can be applied to systems that may differ in their nature, appearance, or scope. Thus, we can begin studying a variety of complex systems and utilize graph data for new cases other than the typical ways of dealing with big data.

A network map is typically organized visually by a force-directed layout algorithm, where nodes find their position on the canvas through connecting forces, revealing the central actors, indirect links, organic clusters, structural holes, and outliers. However, such graph analysis metrics can be programmatically queried on a graph database in order to build graph-driven applications.

*Creative Use of Complex Networks* hackathon is focused on generating new types of graph data (see *[different graph examples](https://graphcommons.com){:target="_blank"}*) and developing creative graph-driven applications (see *[structured journalism hackathon](https://graphcommons.github.io/hackathons/2015/08/21/istanbul-yapisal-gazetecilik-documentation-en/){:target="_blank"})*.

Particularly, there will be two paths of work in the hackathon:

1. Modeling networks for civic issues and generating graph data using variety of resources.

2. Developing creative applications utilizing graph data.

On the one hand, participants will learn more on the network mapping and analysis methods, on the other hand, they will build reusable graph-driven applications.

Hackthon will run in three phases:

<img style="float:right; width:300px" src="http://blog.graphcommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/graphcommons-collaborative-mapping.png">

#### 1. Network modeling and brain storming

Start brain storming with paper & pen drawing of network models. Discuss critical actors and relations in the field of interest. Address primary questions on the issues and decide on possible applications for solutions.

<img style="float:right; width:300px; margin-top:10px;" src="http://blog.graphcommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/graph-json-structure.png">

#### 2. Application development

Depending on the work groups's decision:

- a) Create a data tool that generates graph data from various sources based on the network model decided on the previous session.

- b) Create an application that utilizes an existing or a newly built graph data for its operations and interfaces.

Use **[Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/){:target="_blank"}** and **[Graph Commons](https://graphcommons.com){:target="_blank"}** (**[API](https://graphcommons.com/dev){:target="_blank"}**) to build and query your graph data / network maps. You can use a familiar language or framework in Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, HTML/CSS etc for your application prototypes.

Prototypes should work at the end of the first day for feedback. Use the feedbacks to refine your apps in the second day.

#### 3. Presentations

Present your work at the end of the second day in a public presentations session. Discuss the network model on the issue at hand, its actual data metrics, and how it is utilized in your graph-driven application. Also mention your plan on further iterations.
