    We welcome you to join us, and join one another, in connecting partial information to explore complex relations that impact us and our communities.
</p>
<p>
    Graph Commons is a collaborative 'network mapping' platform and a knowledge base of relationships. You can map relationships at scale and unfold the mystery about complex issues that impact you and your community.
</p>
<p>
    Graph Commons members have been using the platform for investigative journalism, data research, civic activism, strategizing, organizational analysis, systems design, exploring archives, art curating and what not. We believe you will find a unique way to use Graph Commons in your own connected world.
</p>
<p>
    We hope that you will spend some time browsing current graphs and creating new ones. Feel free to share anything you create or find.
